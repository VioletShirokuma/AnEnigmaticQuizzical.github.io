<h2>Description:</h2>

This Coding Quiz application was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The user will be able to start a quiz in relation to pop culture while a countdown is falling, and be able to input their initials and view their overall high score at the end result. The score is calculated by how many questions are answered right within the timeframe.



<h2>Learning Process: </h2>

Building this application furthered delved into Javascript and deeper understanding of complex functions, how elements are put together, and how local storage can be utilized to recall saved data and be able to keep it stored. The idea is to build your template while styling with CSS, using Bootstrap elements and create a functioning quiz page using scripting methods (e.g. Timer, Multiple Choice Selection, Resetting of Data or Page)



<h2>Difficulties/Challenges:</h2>

* Tying together loose ends and seeing where loopholes are within the syntax 

* Understanding what exact code of Javascript was enabling what functions and what elements on the page

* Creating a smooth, streamlined quiz application that did not require any overexcessive syntax, unnecessary elements, or extra page files.
